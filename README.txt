Landing Page Plugin Guide
=====================

This is a basic guide that explains how the landing page plugin works.

NOTE: A html template theme called Sartre is being used with some pre-made CSS files. 
Link to the theme: https://themeforest.net/item/sartre-creative-multipurpose-html-template/13912008

1. I used hooks to override the home welcome section. All the code can be found in the hooks/home.php script
2. The home.php hook script relies on having both CSS files imported. 
3. Note that NOT everything in the CSS files is needed as the home page only uses some of their CSS styling
4. The theme also relies on a custom javascript library called js/timber.master.js to work properly.
